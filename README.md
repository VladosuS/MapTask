# MapTask
===========

Here is a first task I had to complete.
The task was to create application with google map with the marker on current device's location (using GPS) and to display current location's  longitude and latitude in text field under the map.

The Google Map API v2 were used.

All tests were passed using android emulator (with google play services preinstalled), all problems with emulating and Eclipse resolved.

Build made by using Eclipse and the last version of Android SDK and ADT.
